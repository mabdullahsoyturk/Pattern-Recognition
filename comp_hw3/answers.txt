1. There are 146 data points in the dataset.

2. There are 21 features in each person.

3. Number of POIs is 18.

4. There are 35 POIs in total.

5. Total value of the stock belonging to James Prentice: 1095040

6. Number of email messages from Wesley Colwell to persons of interest: 11

7. Value of stock options exercised by Jeffrey K Skilling: 19250000

8. Kenneth L Lay took home the most money. Following is how much money each person get: 

Jeffrey K Skilling: 8682716
Kenneth L Lay: 103559793
Andrew S Fastow: 2424083

9. Number of people who have quantified salary: 95

Number of people who have a known email address: 111

10. Number of people who have NaN for their total payments: 21

The percentage is: 14

11. Number of POIs who have NaN for their total payments: 0

The percentage is: 0

12. I would expect it to associate a "NaN" value with non-POIs since there is no POI without total payments feature.

13. New number of people in the data set: 156
Number of people who have NaN for their total payments: 31
The percentage is: 19

14. New number of POIs in the data set: 28
Number of POIs who have NaN for their total payments: 10
The percentage is: 35

15. I don't think it would be a wise choice since only 10 of the 28 POIs have NaN for total_payments.
