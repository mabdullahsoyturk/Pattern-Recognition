Number of features: 379

SelectPercentile is choosing specified number of features (for example if percentile is defined as 10, it chooses number_of_features/10 features according to the scores of features).

Large value for percentile would probably lead to a more complex decision tree since there would be more features to consider.

The time it takes to train with 1 percentile: 3.64685106277 seconds
The time it takes to train with 10 percentile: 42.9335479736 seconds

Obviously, as percentile increases, the time it takes to train increases.
